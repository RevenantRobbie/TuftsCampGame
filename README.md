Hi, this is the readme file!
uhh, I don't actually know how to start these off so...

Circuit Savant!:
This is a GUI based game about aranging logic gates and running them to see what the output will be.
Originally, there were supposed to be levels and tasks that you had to do with a limited amount of logic gates, but that's too much coding for 1 week and 4 people to do
The purpose of this game is simply to explore how circiuts and logic gates work. There are no real win or lose conditions here, just fun!

How to install and run:
download and unzip the file
type "pip install pygame" into the terminal
run circiutGame1.3b.py
enjoy

How in interact:
left click on the side bar buttons spawn in the desired logic gate
clicking on a logic gate picks it up, clicking on it again puts it down
