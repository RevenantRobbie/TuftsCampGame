Hi, this is the readme file!
uhh, I don't actually know how to start these off so...

Circuit Savant!:
This is a GUI based game about aranging logic gates and running them to see what the output will be.
Originally, there were supposed to be levels and tasks that you had to do with a limited amount of logic gates, but that's too much coding for 1 week and 4 people to do
The purpose of this game is simply to explore how circiuts and logic gates work. There are no real win or lose conditions here, just fun!

How to install and run:
download and unzip the file
type "pip install pygame" into the terminal
run circiutGame1.3b.py
enjoy

How in interact:
left click on the side bar buttons spawn in the desired logic gate
left clicking on a logic gate picks it up, left clicking on it again puts it down
left clicking on a blue node creates an orange wire that you can connect to other nodes (also with left click)
note, you can only connect input nodes to output nodes and vice versa. Inputs don't go with inputs and outputs don't go with outputs in real life
right clicking on a logic gate deletes it (and associated wires and nodes)
clicking on the input box toggles it's state (green = on, red = off)
